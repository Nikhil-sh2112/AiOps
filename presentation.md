**Understood—time is short, so we’ll focus on preparing you to present confidently on AI Ops by Tuesday, keeping it simple yet impactful without diving deep into complex coding.**



**Here’s the focused plan to maximize your readiness by Tuesday:**

**Today (Sunday, Aug 31) — Understand \& Prepare Content**

**Review AI Ops basics (what it is, why important, key components) using simple explanations I shared**



**Understand and explain anomaly detection and monitoring through analogies and the sample Python code you ran**



**Write 3-5 key points per topic in your own words for your presentation slides or notes**



**Avoid complex code or libraries for now**



**Monday, Sept 1 — Build Your Project Demo \& Presentation**

**Use the simple Python anomaly detection code (or similar) as a demo or example in your presentation**



**Structure your slides: Introduction, AI Ops concepts, Data \& Monitoring, Simple Anomaly Detection Demo, Conclusion**



**Practice explaining the code’s logic in plain language — no need for deep technical jargon**



**I will help you create slide text and talking points today or tomorrow**



**Tuesday, Sept 2 — Final Review \& Presentation Practice**

**Rehearse your presentation aloud**



**Prepare answers for likely questions (I can help with this)**



**Relax and be confident — focus on clarity and understanding, not on advanced coding**



**Immediate Next Step for Today**

**Send me the key AI Ops topics or points you want to cover, or I can draft a simple slide outline for you based on what you’ve learned so far. I will also create easy-to-read slide content and talking points you can use.**



**This focused “presentation-first” approach will give you a solid, understandable AI Ops overview with practical examples, fitting your tight timeline.**



**Shall I prepare the slide outline and content for you to review now?**
